# 🔐 SECURITY.md – OCOS Blockchain Protocol

> **"Security is not a feature — it is the foundation. At OCOS, every line of code, every validator, every transaction is protected by design."**

---

### 📌 Purpose of this Document

This document outlines the **comprehensive security architecture, audit strategy, responsible disclosure policy**, and cryptographic infrastructure of the **OCOS Blockchain (S470SHI Chain Layer)**. Our goal is to ensure the ecosystem is **trustless, tamper-resistant, and ZK-secured** for every participant.

## 🔒 Core Security Philosophy

| Principle                  | Implementation Highlights                                     |
|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Immutable by Design**    | Stream-based ledger prevents fork-based time manipulation     |
| **zkNative Privacy**       | Built-in zkSNARK support; all smart vaults shielded by default |
| **Reputation-weighted DAO**| Validator access requires on-chain trust metrics              |
| **Bridge Risk Isolation**  | SuperChain layer mediates external token routes                |
| **No Single Authority**    | Governance is quorum-based, validator-decoupled                |

## 🧱 Layered Security Stack

### 1. 🔐 Protocol Layer
- **Consensus:** Hybrid PoW + PoS with validator filtering
- **Runtime:** Rust-based + WASM-compiled
- **Smart Contracts:** zk-aware, DAO-gated, vault-locked
- **Genesis Verification:** 0.047 BTC-anchored validator genesis system

### 2. 🔗 Bridge Layer (MultiChain Interop)
- Native zk-Swap Gateway with replay protection
- MultiSig-controlled bridge vaults
- Automatic rate-limited withdrawals
- Bridge endpoint registry signed by DAO multisig

### 3. 🧠 DAO + Identity Layer
- Dynamic validator score: `reputation * DAO stake`
- DAO ballots ZK-sealed and IPFS-rooted
- Emergency proposals require zkVote quorum

---

## 🧬 Zero-Knowledge Privacy Shield

All transaction signatures and smart vault unlock conditions are optionally zk-obfuscated:

Circuit: zkShield.v2  
Hashing: Poseidon / SHA3 Hybrid  
Prover: OCOS zkVM (WASM)  
Proof: 512-bit bulletproof (recursive optional)

Example:
```s470shi
vault "CouncilReserve" {
    unlock_at: time + 13 months
    condition: zkProof(DAO.vote("Approved"))
}
```

## 🛡️ Code Auditing & Threat Modeling

### ✅ Internal Audits
- Conducted bi-weekly by OCOS CoreSec
- Scope: contract logic, DAO misbehaviors, liquidity gateway

### 🔍 External Audits
- CertiK (scheduled bi-quarterly)
- Halborn (scheduled Q4 2025)
- All findings published via OCOS GitHub [Audit Reports](../audits/)

---

## 📬 Responsible Disclosure Policy

We welcome white-hat security researchers. To report a vulnerability:

- **Email:** `security@ocos.io`
- **PGP Fingerprint:** `F3D4 7981 C02B ...`
- Reports will be acknowledged within **24 hours**
- Verified disclosures may be eligible for **OCOS Bug Bounty**

---

## 📡 Operational Security (OpSec)

- Validator node IPs are masked by default via relayed nodeNet
- zkValidator consensus ensures byzantine tolerance with <33% malicious quorum
- Key rotation is enforced every epoch by DAO key controller

---

## 📚 Educational & Developer Safety

- Smart contracts written in `s470shi` DSL are linted through zkStaticAnalyzer
- WalletConnect integrations run through sandboxed contexts
- Testnets require DAO approval for any economic impact simulation

---

## 🧠 Final Notes

Security is not just a module in OCOS. It is embedded in the DNA of the chain — from genesis block to zero-knowledge proofs, from DAO ballots to vault withdrawals.
