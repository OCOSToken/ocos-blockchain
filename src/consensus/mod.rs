//! # Consensus Module
//!
//! This module defines the interface and pluggable structure for various consensus algorithms
//! such as Proof of Work (PoW), Proof of Stake (PoS), Delegated PoS, and DAO-based consensus.
//!
//! ## Goals
//! - Decouple consensus logic from the core blockchain
//! - Allow easy swapping of consensus mechanisms
//! - Standardize interaction with mining, validation and block proposal
//!
//! ## Implementations (in this project)
//! - `pow::ProofOfWork`
//! - `pos::ProofOfStake`
//! - Custom DAO governance model (planned)
