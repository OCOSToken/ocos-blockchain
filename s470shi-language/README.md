# 🧬 S470SHI Language Specification

**Project:** S470SHI Chain Protocol
**Component:** Domain-Specific Language (DSL) – Layer Interaction & Governance Execution
**Status:** Open Source – MIT License + Governance Exception

---

## 🔹 Language Name: `S470SHI`

The `S470SHI` language is a domain-specific language designed for:

* DAO-based governance systems
* zkPrivacy-validated smart vaults
* Stream-based transaction execution (non-block)
* Conditional reputation logic
* Time-anchored contracts

It is compiled and executed within the **S470SHI Chain Protocol**, built with:

* **Core Runtime Language:** `Rust`
* **Smart Contract VM Layer:** `WASM (WebAssembly)`
* **Optional DSL Interpreter Layer:** `Go` or `Rust`

---

## 🔧 Language Syntax (Sample)

### 1. DAO Contract

```s470shi
contract DAOValidator {
    require identity.reputation > 47
    dao.vote "Enable zkSwap Layer"
    stream.log "DAO Quorum Reached"
}
```

### 2. zkPrivacy Transfer

```s470shi
zk_transaction {
    from: wallet.alice
    to: treasury.vault
    amount: 0.047
    proof: sha256x("dao-genesis")
    tag: "genesis_funding"
}
```

### 3. Smart Vault Logic

```s470shi
vault "LegacyFund" {
    unlock_at: block.timestamp + 47 weeks
    condition: dao.vote("OCOS 2047 Proposal") == true
    receiver: council.address("genesis")
}
```

## 🔐 Core Design Principles

| Principle              | Description                                           |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| 🧠 Intent Encoding     | Every command embeds symbolic and operational purpose |
| 🔐 zk-Layer Native     | ZK circuits enforced at protocol level                |
| 🧮 Reputation-Based VM | Execution pathways weighted by identity score         |
| ⛓️ Stream Ledger Model | Transactions streamed, not blocked                    |
| 📜 Time Anchoring      | Contracts can be temporally anchored in logic         |
