## 🛠️ Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ocos-blockchain.git
cd ocos-blockchain
cargo run
```

**Your node will run at:**  
- [http://localhost:8080/chain](http://localhost:8080/chain) — Full chain as JSON
- `/add_transaction` — Add new transaction (POST, JSON)
- `/mine` — Mine pending transactions into a block
- `/validate` — Validate chain integrity
